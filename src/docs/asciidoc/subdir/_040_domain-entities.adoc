== Domain Entities

* Domain entities are the building blocks of Apache Isis applications, being the persistent objects with which
end-users view and interact

* From a programming perspective, they are basically pojos, with some JDO annotations


=== Renaming `SimpleObject`

* Rename `SimpleObject` to a core entity of your domain
** eg to `Customer`
** rename class name in JDOQL annotations also

* rename corresponding `SimpleObjects` repository also
** eg `Customers`

* rename the `RecreateSimpleObjects` fixture
** eg `RecreateCustomers`




=== Scalar properties

* Properties are defined as a normal link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_get[getter]/link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_set[setter] pair
** normally used by both Apache Isis (for the UI) and by DataNucleus (for the DB)

* The link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_classes_value-types[property's type] can be
a primitive, a wrapper type, a Joda time type, or an Isis-specific type (eg ``Blob``/``Clob``)

* You may need to add some JDO-specific annotations
** typically link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgant.html#_rgant-Column[`@Column(allowsNull=...)`]
** if problems, a validation failure is thrown at start-up



=== Project Lombok

* You can also use link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_project-lombok[Project Lombok] to remove the getter/setters

* Usually as simple as adding the mvn dependency: +
+
[source,xml]

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.16.6</version>
