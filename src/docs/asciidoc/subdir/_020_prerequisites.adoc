== Prerequisites

* Apache Isis is a Java framework, so you'll need:

** Java JDK
** Apache Maven
** an IDE




=== JDK and Maven

* You'll need JDK 8 (preferred) or 7

** if necessary, download link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java 8 JDK] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java 7 JDK] and install

* You'll also need Apache Maven to be installed
** download link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven 3.x]
** ensure that `mvn` is on your `$PATH`



=== Configure Settings to use beta


* You can use the latest beta of the framework by adding a couple of changes to `~/m2/settings.xml`.

* This will set up mvn to locate the `1.13.0-beta1` (rather than `1.12.2`)

[TIP]
====
These steps are optional but recommended - peppered throughout the documentation you'll see we indicate any forthcoming features by specifying "(as of `1.13.0-SNAPSHOT`)"; making this change means that you'll pick up those new features.

=== IDEs

* We strongly recommend you use an IDE

* Most of the Apache Isis committers use IntelliJ (community edition is fine) or Eclipse, but use one with which you are familiar.

** IntelliJ link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[download], link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_intellij_file-templates[file templates], link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_intellij_live-templates[live templates]

** Eclipse link:https://eclipse.org/downloads/[download], link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_eclipse_editor-templates[editor templates]

* If using Eclipse, you'll also require the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_add_datanucleus_support[DataNucleus plugin]



=== Documentation

This tutorial has plenty of links to useful documentation, but you might also want to:

* bookmark the link:http://isis.apache.org/documentation.html[Apache Isis documentation] page.
* download link:http://isis.apache.org/cheat-sheet.html[Cheat sheet]
