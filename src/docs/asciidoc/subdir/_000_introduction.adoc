== A Quick Introduction

* Apache Isis is a Java framework that uses link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket] and
link:http://resteasy.jboss.org/[JBoss RestEasy] (JAX-RS) for its presentation layer, and link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] for its persistence layer (using link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/api.html[JDO]).

* To use Apache Isis you don't need to know any Wicket or JAX-RS, but you will over time become familiar with
DataNucleus' link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/annotations.html[JDO annotations].

* Apache Isis is itself built using link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven], and the framework provides a Maven archetype as the starting point for your own domain applications



=== A framework, not a library

* Apache Isis is a framework, not a library

* (Generally speaking) the framework calls your code, not the other way around
** acts as a container

* It implements the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_ugfun_core-concepts_philosophy_hexagonal-architecture[hexagonal architecture] (also known as ports-and-adapters).



=== For Problem Solvers...

* Apache Isis' sweet spot is for back-office "line-of-business" systems, for complex domains

* The end-users of such systems are often quite expert in the domain

* The naked objects philosophy is to empower such users with the tools to do their job, without prescribing how to do that job

* The Wicket viewer is designed for this environment


=== ... or Process Followers

* On the other hand, sometimes the users are _not_ domain experts and require more guidance

* The Wicket viewer does provide an extensibility API to allow more customized/tailored views

* Alternatively, the REST API automatically provided by the Restful Objects viewer can be used as the backend to custom mobile apps (eg AngularJS) or for microservices

* A link:http://swagger.io/[Swagger UI] makes the REST API easy to develop against


=== Applib

* The Apache Isis "applib" is the single point of contact between domain objects and the rest
of the framework

* It mainly consists of the API to a variety of domain services

* It also defines a number of value types that can optionally be used (eg `Password`, `Blob`) and for link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_classes_i18n[i18n support] (`TranslatableString`)

=== Exercise: Choose a domain

* Choose a small domain to work on throughout this tutorial
** 3 or 4 entities, say

* For example:
** holiday cottage letting
** lending library
** restaurant reviews
** contact manager
** taxi-ride booking system
