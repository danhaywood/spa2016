== Add-ons

* The link:http://www.isisaddons.org/[Isis Addons] catalog provides:
** implementations for multiple cross-cutting concerns
*** security, publishing, auditing etc.
** support for feature{nbsp}toggles

* The link:http://catalog.incode.org/[Incode] catalog provides reusable business components


=== Security

* The link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security] module is the most commonly used add-on

* User, role, permissions, functions
** functions inferred from the Apache Isis metamodel

* Users can be defined locally or delegated (eg from LDAP)

* Permissions can be
** scoped to package-level, class or member
** are additive or subtractive
*** "can only access ..." vs "can access all but..."

* Includes an elegant design for multi-tenancy


=== Publishing

* The link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[publishmq] module implements the link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] SPI domain service

* It publishes events (link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_schema-ixn[XML representation] of an action invocation or a property edit) onto an link:activemq.apache.org[ActiveMQ] queue

* Events are optionally persisted, for replay

* Can associate "status message" objects with events
** eg for logging/diagnostics, tracking conversations etc


=== Commands

* The link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[command] module implements link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] and link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`] SPI services

* Like publishing, also captures and persists an link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_schema-cmd[XML representation] of an action invocation or property edit

* However, the intention is different: to allow the command execution to be deferred ("run in the background")


=== Auditing

* The link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[audit] module implements the link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`] SPI domain service

* Persists every change to every property of every domain object as an audit entry

* Audit entries correlate back to any persisted command or publishing events, making for a very complete audit record
** command or publishing captures the "cause"
** auditing captures the "effect"



=== Togglz

* The link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-togglz[togglz] module integrates the link:http://www.togglz.org[Togglz] feature{nbsp}toggle library with Apache Isis

** The link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[settings] module is used to persist which toggles are enabled/disabled

* The integration includes:
** a web console to inspect toggles, and
** a JUnit rule to allow toggles to be controlled within unit/integration tests

=== Exercise: Integrate an add-on

* Integrate one of the add-ons into your application

** Each of the modules has a README with complete instructions
** Each module also has a demo app; just check out the corresponding repo from github and run
