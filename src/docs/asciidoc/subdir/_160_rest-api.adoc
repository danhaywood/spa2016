== REST API

* REST API implements the link:http://www.restfulobjects.org/[Restful Objects specification].
** a generic hypermedia API for any domain object, defining both RESTful resources and representations
** also implemented by link:https://github.com/NakedObjectsGroup/NakedObjectsFramework[Naked Objects framework] (.NET)

* The REST API is inferred automatically from the domain object model
** eg `objects/CUS:123/actions/placeOrder`

* Can also return alternative REST representations
** as per the `HTTP Accept` header



=== Swagger UI

* Can be accessed at link:http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui]
** This is a javascript client that downloads the link:http://swagger.io/specification/[Swagger spec] for the domain

* The swagger spec organizes resources into groups

* In fact, three variants of the swagger spec, for different client types



=== Swagger UI Access levels

* The `public` API intended for external 3rd party clients
** ie require backward compatibility
** exposes only domain services with a link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgant.html#_rgant-DomainService_nature[nature] of `VIEW_REST_ONLY` and returning link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_dtos[view model DTO]s

* The `private` API intended for internal clients
** exposes all domain entities

* The Swagger spec can also be downloaded from Wicket viewer
** eg to code-generate client stubs in any language



=== Direct Access

* The Swagger UI only exposes the most commonly used parts of the REST API

* Full access is available at link:http://localhost:8080/restful[http://localhost:8080/restful]

* Test using a browser plugin such as link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop[Postman], link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo[Advanced REST Client] (both Chrome) or link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/[REST Client] (Firefox)


=== Alternative Representations

* Alternative representations can be provided by implementing either link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_spi_ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`] or the lower-level

* The framework provides one suchalternative to that defined by the Restful Objects spec
** namely the link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/ugvro.html#_ugvro_simplified-representations["simplified"] representation
** intended for use by common libraries such as link:http://angular-formly.com[Angular Formly]

=== Exercise: exploring the REST API

* Use the Swagger UI to explore the REST API available by your client

* Add `VIEW_REST_ONLY` domain services to provide a restricted public API

* (optional) checkout the link:github.com/incodehq/contactapp[contactapp], an Apache Isis app with a custom mobile app implemented using link:http://ionicframework.com/[Ionic framework] (on top of link:https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS])
