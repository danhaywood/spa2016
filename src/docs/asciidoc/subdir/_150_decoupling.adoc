== Decoupling

* You can use Apache Isis to build both monoliths{nbsp}and{nbsp}microservices
** but often microservices = over-engineering

* however, monoliths must be modular
** otherwise, you'll end up with a link:http://www.laputan.org/mud/[big ball of mud]

* the framework provides several tools to ensure modularity



=== Mixins

* link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_decoupling_mixins[Mixins] separate business logic (actions) from state (properties/collections)

* mixes-in based on object's type (including interfaces)
** deepens the (DDD) ubiquitous language
** eg `Annotated`, `HasEvents`

* Net effect: move behaviour from one module to another


=== Mixins

[source,java]
----
public class Customer implements Annotated {
  ...
}
----

* mixed-in using:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Annotated_annotations {
  Annotated annotated;
  public Annotated_annotations(Annotated annotated) {
      this.annotated = annotated;
  }
  public List<Annotation> annotations() { ... }
}
----



=== Event subscribers

* Event subscribers are notified of events originating in some other module
** can veto the interaction
** can react to the interaction, eg cascade delete

* Net effect: moves validation rules/triggers from one module to another



=== Event subscribers (ctd)

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
  public static class CompletedEvent
             extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> { }
  @Action(domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class)
  public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
}
----

* subscribed to using:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber
               extends AbstractSubscriber {
  @Subscribe
  public void on(ToDoItem.CompletedEvent ev) { ... }
}
----



=== `WrapperFactory`

* The link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`] should be used for cross-module interactions
** ie across a trust-boundary

* any domain events for the callee will be fired
** akin to no-interface interaction between EJBs (though need to manually wrap)




=== Poly module

* The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly[Isis addons' poly] module defines an implementation pattern to decouple modules at the persistence layer
** a.k.a the "table of two halves" pattern

* at the domain object layer, associations defined via (Java) interfaces

* at the database layer, regular foreign keys throughout

* examples include link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias[`alias`], link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel[`commchannel`] and link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-note[`note`]
** all part of the (Apache-licensed) link:http://catalog.incode.org/[incode catalog].
