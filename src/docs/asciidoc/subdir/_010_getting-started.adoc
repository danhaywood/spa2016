== Getting Started

* Apache Isis is a Java framework that uses link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket] and
link:http://resteasy.jboss.org/[JBoss RestEasy] (JAX-RS) for its presentation layer, and link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] for its persistence layer (using link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/api.html[JDO]).

* To use Apache Isis you don't need to know any Wicket or JAX-RS, but you will over time become familiar with
DataNucleus' link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/annotations.html[JDO annotations].

* Apache Isis is itself built using link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven], and the framework provides a Maven archetype as the starting point for your own domain applications built on top of the framework.



=== A framework, not a library

* Apache Isis is a framework, not a library

* (Generally speaking) the framework calls your code, not the other way around
** Acts as a container

* An implementation of the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_ugfun_core-concepts_philosophy_hexagonal-architecture[hexagonal architecture].



=== Applib

* The Apache Isis "applib" is the single point of contact between domain objects and the rest
of the framework

* Main contents is default domain services implemented by the framework

* Also defines a number of value types that can optionally be used (eg `Password`, `Blob`) and for link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms.html#_rgcms_classes_i18n[i18n support] (specifically `TranslatableString`)
