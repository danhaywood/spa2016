== Getting Started

* Apache Isis is a Java framework that uses link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket] and
link:http://resteasy.jboss.org/[JBoss RestEasy] (JAX-RS) for its presentation layer, and link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] for its persistence layer (using link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/api.html[JDO]).

* To use Apache Isis you don't need to know any Wicket or JAX-RS, but you will over time become familiar with
DataNucleus' link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/annotations.html[JDO annotations].

* Apache Isis is itself built using link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven], and the framework provides a Maven archetype as the starting point for your own domain applications built on top of the framework.
