== Apache Isis Maven plugin

* The Maven plugin supports a variety of use cases:

** validate the metamodel at build time
** generate swagger specification
** generate XSDs from view model DTOs


=== Validation

* When an Apache Isis app starts up, the metamodel is validated for semantic consistency
** eg all supporting methods must match up with a class member

* The link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn.html#_rgmvn_validate[`validate`] goal performs this checking during build time, so that such errors are detected as early as possible



=== Swagger Spec

* The link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_api_SwaggerService[`SwaggerService`] allows the link:http://swagger.io/specification/[swagger spec] to be downloaded within the app

* The link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn.html#_rgmvn_swagger[`swagger`] goal allows the spec to be generated during build time

* The build can therefore use this swagger spec in downstream build jobs, eg to build and compile client-side stubs in various programming languages



=== XSD generation

* JAXB-annotated link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb[view models] are useful as DTOs for integrating systems, eg over SOAP or an ESB

* For these scenarios, having an XSD schema corresponding to the JAXB model enables stronger validation in consumers and possibility to code-gen in other languages

* The link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn.html#_rgmvn_xsd[`xsd`] goal can be used to generate these XSDs
** using the link:https://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_api_JaxbService[`JaxbService`] under the covers

=== Exercise: leveraging mvn plugins

* Force a metamodel validation exception, eg by misspelling a supporting method
** confirm that rebuilding the app fails in the `dom` module
