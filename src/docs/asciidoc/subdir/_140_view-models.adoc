== View Models

* Why link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_view-models[view models]?

** Not every entity is necessarily persisted by DataNucleus

** Not every domain object is even an entity

** High-volume use cases require specialist views to aggregate/consolidate multiple domain objects

** Exposing domain entities over REST a bad idea if don't control the client



=== View Model Support

* Apache Isis allows view models to be defined to represent such domain objects
** analogous to an (RDBMS) view on top of an table

* Several programming models available, but most flexible/straightforward uses link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb[JAXB annotations]

* the state of the view model is serialized into the URL (rather than the DB)
** or as per link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_spi_UrlEncodingService[`UrlEncodingService`] SPI implementation, if any



=== JAXB

* eg:

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement
@XmlType( propOrder = { "left", "right" } )
public class CompareCustomers {

    @XmlElement(required = true)
    @Getter @Setter
    private Customer left;

    @XmlElement(required = true)
    @Getter @Setter
    private Customer right;
}
----


=== Referenced entities

* entities referenced must be link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgant.html#_rgant-XmlJavaTypeAdapter[annotated] with `PersistentEntityAdapter`
** serializes out the entity's id, rather than the entire state of the entity

* eg: +
+
[source,java]
----
@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(PersistentEntityAdapter.class)
public class Customer {
  ...
}
----


=== Home page

* Exactly one domain service action can be annotated with link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgant.html#_rgant-HomePage[`@HomePage`]

** Automatically invoked whenver user navigates to home

* Typically returns a view model that acts as a dashboard
** with a heavily customised link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic_xml[`.layout.xml`]

=== Exercise: define a home page

* Create a view model to represent the home page of your application

* Annotate a domain service that returns this home page view model
