link:http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/[reveal.js] as the rendering backend.

== Getting Started

* Apache Isis is a Java framework that uses link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket] and
link:http://resteasy.jboss.org/[JBoss RestEasy] (JAX-RS) for its presentation layer, and link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] for its persistence layer (using link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/api.html[JDO]).

* To use Apache Isis you don't need to know any Wicket or JAX-RS, but you will over time become familiar with
DataNucleus' link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/annotations.html[JDO annotations].

* Apache Isis is itself built using link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven], and the framework provides a Maven archetype as the starting point for your own domain applications built on top of the framework.



== Prerequisites

* Java and Maven
* An IDE
* Documentation bookmarks



=== JDK and Maven

* You'll need JDK 8 (preferred) or 7

** Download link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java 8 JDK] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java 7 JDK]

* You'll also need Apache Maven installed, with `mvn` on your `$PATH`

** Download link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven 3.x]



=== IDEs

* We strongly recommend you use an IDE

* Most of the Apache Isis committers use IntelliJ (community edition is fine) or Eclipse, but use one with which you are familiar.

** IntelliJ link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[download], link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_intellij_file-templates[file templates], link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_intellij_live-templates[live templates]

** Eclipse link:https://eclipse.org/downloads/[download], link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_eclipse_editor-templates[editor templates]

* If using Eclipse, you'll also require the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_add_datanucleus_support[DataNucleus plugin]



=== Documentation

Worth bookmarking/downloading:

* link:http://isis.apache.org/documentation.html[Apache Isis documentation] page.
* link:http://isis.apache.org/cheat-sheet.html[Cheat sheet]
* link:http://isis.apache.org/screencasts.html[Screencasts]




== Simpleapp archetype

* Use the `simpleapp` archetype to link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_generating_the_app[generate] a new empty application

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.12.2 \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B
----

Explore the app once generated (multiple subdirectories)


=== Build the app

* The newly generated app can be link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_building_the_app[built] from the command{nbsp}line:

[source,bash]
----
cd myapp
mvn clean install
----

* Better still though is to import the app into the IDE
** link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_intellij_importing-maven-modules[IntelliJ]
** link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_eclipse_importing-the-project[Eclipse]



=== Running the app

* Run the app from the command line
** using link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_using_mvn_jetty_plugin[mvn jetty plugin]

* Run the app from the IDE
** using a link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_from_within_the_ide[launch configuration]).

[TIP]
====
It's worth spending the time learning how to run the app from the IDE.  In particular, get to grips with the
DataNucleus Enhancer.
